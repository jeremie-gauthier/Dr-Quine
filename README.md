# Dr-Quine

Creation of self-replicating programs

## Objectives

This project introduces us to self-replicating programs (also called [Quines](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quine_(computing)>)).

It's an introduction to the malware projects of 42Paris.

## Features

All the quines have been coded in C and JavaScript.

You can use the `test.sh` file in each Quine to test its validity. No output means no error.
